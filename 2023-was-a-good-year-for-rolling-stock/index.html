That doesn't mean that nothing has happened in the 24 square metres of the train room, but it was mostly small additions and experiments. Lack of time and energy has prevented major developments.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The single biggest development is possibly the completion of the branch line, which traverses an incline to a second layer sitting about 25cm above the main layer, looping around what is intended to be a small village, surrounded by farm lands. This piece of track has been built, wired and tested successfully. It is mainly aimed at two railcar models I own, longer trains will not travel on this branch line.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The other major development is a replacement of the command station and some adjacent accessories. Nearly five years ago I acquired a <a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/2019/02/17/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new/">Digikeijs DR5000</a> to replace the suboptimal NCE PowerCab I was using at the time. That command station has served me well, but during the last year two issues arose. One was that the manufacturer went insolvent and left the market, ending direct support for the command station. That was mitigated to a degree by YaMoRC, a new company founded by the original designer of the DR5000 (and other Digikeijs products). YaMoRC are developing a series of products quite similar to what Digikeijs was offering, but more modern and with ongoing, direct support. They sold a module which allowed an upgrade of the DR5000 and enabled it to use YaMoRC firmware. So far so good, I actually acquired one of those modules and successfully upgraded my command station.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But amidst some ongoing niggles I had with the setup, like flaky WiFi and somewhat unreliable controls, I got to the point where I realised that I wanted to move on from the DR5000. More importantly, I wanted to move on from app control, which was never really that enjoyable for me, and towards something more haptic. The thing about app control is that when you're setting speed and selecting functions, your eyes are on the app, not the train. Sure, I could have gotten one of the many physical controllers that are compatible with the DR5000, but the prospect didn't quite satisfy me, since I would still have to have a laptop next to it to control points and accessories. My ideal solution was a bit more of an all-in-one setup. Most of all, I wanted a nice, big, physical, easy-to-reach STOP button to quickly avert the odd disaster I seem to be prone to causing.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ultimately the DR5000 was replaced by an ESU ECoS 50210. I won't go into too much detail here - a lot has been written about this command station - but its combination of physical controls and touch screen is pretty much what I envisioned for a hassle-free, easy-to-use control setup, that can still be complemented with software for more advanced automation and such. The rotary controllers on the ECoS are fantastic, I've never enjoyed just running trains as much as with this station. Let's see if it lasts longer than five year with me...</p><p></p><p></p><p>Most of all, 2023 was a good year for rolling stock. We acquired some very nice additions to the fleet, which I will list in a bit more detail below.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The first acquisition of the year was a rake of container wagons, to match the NR class loco we've had for a while. I got two sets of RQTY wagons produced by SDS Models, in two different liveries: blue-orange for the National Rail SeaTrain livery with which these wagons were used for traffic between Sydney and Brisbane. The other livery is the later yellow-grey livery of Pacific National, the successor of National Rail. I can rationalise the mix of liveries - National Rail was privatised in 2002, but NR52 had its old National Rail livery until at least 2007, so it is perfectly plausible that there may have been a mix of liveries among the rolling stock as well.We still need loads for these wagons, but it will all happen in good time.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I ended up bringing home a few things from a mid-year trip to Germany. One of them was the measuring wagon from Piko, a pretty nifty gadget which allows you to measure speed, distances, track voltage, incline grades and more. The main use case for this one is to calibrate locomotive speeds, i.e. determine which speed step corresponds to which scale speed. This is important for layout automation software, which does its calculations based on exactly these data.</p><p></p><p></p><p>From a model train exchange in Germany I picked up a set of Interregio wagons. These are still older models in 1:100 length scale, but they're nice enough, and since I already had a matching carriage in my fleet, so now there's a nice train of five carriages. The previous owner installed interior lights in some of the carriages as well as red rear lights in one. That looks quite nice but obviously I need to do a bit more work to make all carriages light up.</p><p></p><p></p><p>From the same exchange I grabbed two more Schicht carriages. I am a big fan of these models which were made in East Germany, and which don't show their age if treated well. These two Bme 2nd class carriages are in very good condition and still have working interior lights. A bit later, after my return, I picked up another Schicht carriage from an Australian seller, an Ame 1st Class coach in absolutely pristine condition. These carriages will definitely run on my layout, but I have some work planned for them, like replacing the couplers and interior lights.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The last catch from the Germany trip was the RegioShuttle from Roco in Vogtlandbahn livery. I traveled on the actual train twice, so I couldn't resist when I saw the model in the shops.</p><p></p><p></p><p>While in Germany, I visited a train festival at which I got up close to a preserved and running BR 120. Originally built for Deutsche Reichsbahn from the late 1960s, a few of these heavy Diesel locomotives have been picked up by private operators and non-profit associations for the purpose of preservation and restoration. Seeing this piece of railway so closely left a bit of an impression, and when a few weeks later an exemplar of the Piko model appeared on eBay, I jumped on it. This model is a great runner, like all Piko locos I have, and I'm really glad I got it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The last acquisition for the year was something a bit more unusual for us. With two exceptions, all our models are diesel locomotives and railcars. However, later in the year I came across a second hand offering that was hard to resist. It was a model of a BR 011 steam locomotive of Deutsche Bundesbahn, second hand but in pristine condition, and already equipped with a DCC decoder. By good coincidence I had some carriages in my fleet that matched the era and purpose of this particular locomotive, so this was an easy purchase. I did not have large steam on my radar but sometimes that's how the chips fall...</p><p></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee5c2941d2997b864e9173c270513a0c?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" height="240" width="240" alt="Alex"><div><h3><a href="https://alex-hempel.github.io/makingtracks/authors/alex/" class="invert" rel="author">Alex</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><div><strong>You should also read:</strong></div><div class="posts"><article><header><time datetime="2020-12-23T15:59" class="date">23 December 2020</time><h2><a href="https://alex-hempel.github.io/makingtracks/my-model-railway-year-in-review/">My Model Railway Year in Review</a></h2></header><a href="https://alex-hempel.github.io/makingtracks/my-model-railway-year-in-review/" class="image fit"><img src="https://alex-hempel.github.io/makingtracks/media/posts/34/img_2274-scaled.jpg" srcset="https://alex-hempel.github.io/makingtracks/media/posts/34/responsive/img_2274-scaled-xs.jpg 300w, https://alex-hempel.github.io/makingtracks/media/posts/34/responsive/img_2274-scaled-sm.jpg 480w, https://alex-hempel.github.io/makingtracks/media/posts/34/responsive/img_2274-scaled-md.jpg 768w, https://alex-hempel.github.io/makingtracks/media/posts/34/responsive/img_2274-scaled-lg.jpg 1024w, https://alex-hempel.github.io/makingtracks/media/posts/34/responsive/img_2274-scaled-xl.jpg 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="1920" width="2560" alt=""></a><p>Last year, we had a bit of a holiday haul.
