I don't know for how long this will be the case, but at the very least a month or two will pass until I can do <i>anything.</i></p><p>I will have to dismantle my layout, pack up all my rolling stock and accessories, and salvage as much as I can from the track, wiring and other materials I've used so far.</p><p>I won't be able to tackle another large layout for at least a year, but I am thinking of building a small interim layout, just so I can run trains, try out new rolling stock, continue my exploratory learning, and work on things like Project Pendolino and other rolling stock modifications I've been planning for a long time. I have space for something approx. 2.4x1.2m, or 8x4ft. The next weeks will bring more clarity.</p><p>On the downside, change and disruption like this is always hard. We have hobbies to help us unwind and relax. The thought of not even being able to put trains on track for a while and watch them run around in a circle makes me sad.</p><p>On the upside, I will have somewhat more time to do these things, and for any future projects I have acquired some good learnings on what to do and what do avoid doing. In a way I am glad to be rid of the now old train room - it had some serious issues that were unfixable and caused immense amounts of stress.</p><p>If you've been reading this blog, or even leaving comments on my socials, thank you, I really appreciate it. Keep an eye out for updates, I will be back with more - just not sure when.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee5c2941d2997b864e9173c270513a0c?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" height="240" width="240" alt="Alex"><div><h3><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/authors/alex/" class="invert" rel="author">Alex</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><div><strong>You should also read:</strong></div><div class="posts"><article><header><time datetime="2022-10-14T10:55" class="date">14 October 2022</time><h2><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/a-brief-update-on-what-happened-while-this-blog-was-offline/">A Brief Update on what happened while this blog was offline</a></h2></header><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/a-brief-update-on-what-happened-while-this-blog-was-offline/" class="image fit"><img src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/41/img_5211-scaled.jpg" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/41/responsive/img_5211-scaled-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/41/responsive/img_5211-scaled-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/41/responsive/img_5211-scaled-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/41/responsive/img_5211-scaled-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/41/responsive/img_5211-scaled-xl.jpg 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="1440" width="2560" alt=""></a><p></p><p></p><p>Earlier this year, I took this blog offline for a variety of reasons - lack of time was one of them, and the cost factor also played a role. I wasn't sure whether it would come back, but I kept a backup either way. But in the meantime, some good progress was made on the build, and a few other things happened which both warrant articles to examine them in detail, and made me feel like I want to write about them.</p><p></p><ul class="actions special"><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/a-brief-update-on-what-happened-while-this-blog-was-offline/" class="button">Full Story</a></li></ul></article></div></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Â© Alex Hempel 2018-2025.
