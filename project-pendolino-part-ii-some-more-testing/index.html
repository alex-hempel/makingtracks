It didn't pan out perfectly, but it was a start - and a good opportunity to get a look at the model's internals. Now I need to figure out a way forward from there. The next step will be to replace the decoder.</p><p>The interior of the model is actually quite nicely constructed. It's easy to disassemble and neatly organised.&nbsp;The current decoder is hardwired into the model, by way of a small piece of PCB that acts as a connector between the motor and chassis, which are using Fleischmann's FMZ wire colour scheme, and the TWIN decoder which has DCC wire colours. A plastic cover hides the wires between the rows of seats. When I replace the decoder, I will need to rewire parts of the model as well. I may even try to use consistent wire colours as much as feasible.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/67/gallery/IMG_7714.jpg" data-size="4032x2268" data-gall="galleryGroup-1" data-title="The model&#39;s interior, with a plastic cover between the seats..."><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/67/gallery/IMG_7714-thumbnail.jpg" height="405" width="720" alt=""></a><figcaption>The model's interior, with a plastic cover between the seats...</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/67/gallery/IMG_7716.jpg" data-size="4032x2268" data-gall="galleryGroup-1" data-title="... which hides the wires nicely"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/67/gallery/IMG_7716-thumbnail.jpg" height="405" width="720" alt=""></a><figcaption>... which hides the wires nicely</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/67/gallery/IMG_7706.jpg" data-size="4032x2268" data-gall="galleryGroup-1" data-title="The decoder sits in a cutout between the seats"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/67/gallery/IMG_7706-thumbnail.jpg" height="405" width="720" alt=""></a><figcaption>The decoder sits in a cutout between the seats</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>While my original thought had been to wire in an 8-pin socket and use a corresponding decoder, I have since moved away from that idea. This has several reasons. One is that I have a fairly strong dislike against 8-pin decoders; their wiring harnesses tend to require shortening, and they often have additional dangling wires which are difficult to tame without either additional soldering or other stunts. The other is that I can't find an 8-pin socket or breakout board that will reasonably fit into the model without being overly noticeable from the outside.</p><p>The old decoder sits on a cutout between the seats, which is approximately the same size as the chip - 26x11mm. Something I can fit there quite nicely is a Next18 connector - several options with very nice fits are available. The advantage of using Next18 is that decoders tend to be smaller than 21MTC or PluX versions - they are normally intended for TT and N scale models. This comes with a drawback: those scales tend to have a lower power draw than H0. So many of the available decoders - and most of the ones I would consider - are limited to 0.7A for the motor. That is a bit less than the Fleischmann decoder, which is specced for 0.8A motor current. Decoders with a lower spec are therefore risky. I can get decoders with a higher motor current limit - but I have to import them from Europe. So that part will take a while.</p><p>And before I took the plunge on that, I wanted to get at least an idea if a new decoder could improve the model's driving characteristics, or if I would have to think along different lines. I still have some LaisDCC decoders sitting around - they're TCS knock-offs, and don't have particularly good motor control. In previous usage scenariosm they also had some funky issues around lighting. I have no intention of ever again using them operationally, but I figured one of them would be good enough for testing. So with some careful soldering, I removed the old Fleischmann decoder and wired it in.&nbsp;</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/67/gallery/IMG_7747.jpg" data-size="4032x2268" data-gall="galleryGroup-2" data-title="This is what a decommissioned Fleischmann TWIN decoder looks like"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/67/gallery/IMG_7747-thumbnail.jpg" height="405" width="720" alt=""></a><figcaption>This is what a decommissioned Fleischmann TWIN decoder looks like</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>The subsequent driving test gave a better result than expected. The model drives quite smoothly at higher speeds, accelerates and decelerates nicely. There are some issues at low speeds, they could be related either to power pickup or the choke coil, but I also don't expect the Lais to have particularly fine motor control on ye olde Fleischmann pancake motor - a German make is more likely to handle these motors well, and I might even be able to find recommendations for the best settings.</p><p>But now I have more certainty about the next step, and can go about procuring the required materials. This will take time, so just watch this space. In the meantime, here is a short clip of the Pendolino tilting through a curve.</p><div><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pendolino 1" width="560" height="315" src="https://makertube.net/videos/embed/hBWPPu1S94SoymH6DDdhyw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms"></iframe></div></div></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__tag"><h3>Tagged in:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/tags/dcc/">DCC</a></li><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/tags/rolling-stock/">Rolling Stock</a></li><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/tags/trains/">Trains</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee5c2941d2997b864e9173c270513a0c?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" height="240" width="240" alt="Alex"><div><h3><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/authors/alex/" class="invert" rel="author">Alex</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><div><strong>You should also read:</strong></div><div class="posts"><article><header><time datetime="2025-03-18T11:00" class="date">18 March 2025</time><h2><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/project-pendolino-part-i-lets-get-it-moving-shall-we/">Project Pendolino, Part I: Let&#x27;s get it moving, shall we?</a></h2></header><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/project-pendolino-part-i-lets-get-it-moving-shall-we/" class="image fit"><img src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/66/IMG_7692.jpg" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/66/responsive/IMG_7692-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/66/responsive/IMG_7692-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/66/responsive/IMG_7692-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/66/responsive/IMG_7692-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/66/responsive/IMG_7692-xl.jpg 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="2268" width="4032" alt=""></a><p></p><p>This Fleischmann BR 610 really is a lovely model.
