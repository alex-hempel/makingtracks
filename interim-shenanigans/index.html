While the <a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/the-new-train-room-one-step-closer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new train room</a> is ready to go by now, work on the new layout has been postponed for now. I would like to have all the track and materials required for the build ready to go, which will take a few more months.</p><p>I have the majority of the required track, but still need at least one pack of flextrack and a bunch of turnouts. I have most of the track underlay, but still need some more for the staging area. On the electronics side, a booster and a few reverse loop modules are needed before the build can commence - the modules are on their way, but are taking their time.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the meantime, the train room has been given a paint job, including the beginnings of a scenic background all around the walls. The previous, small layout has been re-assembled. This way, the trains can stretch their legs every now and then instead of sitting in a box for several months. And I have a playground for some testing and experiments.</p><p></p><p></p><p>On the outside, the doorframe has been completed, so the door can close properly. Some decorations have gone up, but the outside walls still need a paint job.</p><p></p><p></p><p>We did some work in the storage area. I salvaged two lockable office cupboards from my previous workplace, and a bunch of shelves here and there. Today we went through and organised everything, and it's good to know that there's still room for more - we will need it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>My BR175 diesel railcar is finally operating. I acquired a main decoder for it, but still needed two function decoders to operate the lights in the end cars. For that, I used my two low-end decoders which were harvested from the old <a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/a-new-ticker-for-the-zebra/">track tester</a>, and the little steam loco. The latter will get a new decoder in time, the former has been decommissioned - it never ran to any degree of satisfaction and was therefore never suited for the task at hand. Scroll down for a short clip of the 'Vindobona' in action.</p><p></p><p></p><p>And what to do with a decommissioned loco? It went into a display cabinet, along with a few other model trains we have acquired but won't be running, and a bunch of train-related paraphernalia and books.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Long story short, even though the new layout still has to wait, there's always other work to do, and fun to be had.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/35/gallery/img_3575.jpg" data-size="4032x2268" data-gall="galleryGroup-1" data-title="The outside.
