Since I see these regularly close to where we live, it made sense to get one of those for our endeavours.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It is interesting to note that the predominant railway track gauge in Queensland is 1067mm (3ft 6in) narrow gauge, and in fact Queensland has the second-largest narrow-gauge railway network in the world. The rest of Australia largely uses the more common 1435mm standard gauge, with some broad gauge (1600mm) being present in Victoria. Modellers who focus on Queensland models may build their layouts accordingly, using 12mm track instead of the standard 16.5mm H0 gauge. Model manufacturers accommodate that by offering their models for both gauges.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I opted for the 16.5mm version with DCC and sound, mainly because I won't necessarily be focusing purely on Queensland models, and want to be a bit more flexible with what I can run on my layout. I preordered this model back in July, but it had been in the works for a few years at Southern Rail, and production got underway just in time for most orders to be serviced just before Christmas. I received mine a few days ago, but wanted to take my time and properly unpack and test it in daylight.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So, let's get this thing out of the box, shall we?</p><p></p><p></p><p>The 2300 Class model is presented in a sturdy, unostentatious box decorated in a simple colour scheme, with Queensland maroon.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/17/gallery/img_0499.jpg" data-size="4032x3024" data-gall="galleryGroup-1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/17/gallery/img_0499-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540"></a></figure></div></div><p>My chosen version is the running number 2336D, which I happened to spot in real life on the way to work the day I placed the order for this model.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/17/gallery/img_0500-1.jpg" data-size="4032x3024" data-gall="galleryGroup-2"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/17/gallery/img_0500-1-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540"></a></figure></div></div><p>Upon opening the box, the first things you see (and take out) are a full-colour user manual and a large sheet with the explosion diagram and parts list.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/17/gallery/img_0502-1.jpg" data-size="4032x3024" data-gall="galleryGroup-3"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/17/gallery/img_0502-1-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540"></a></figure></div></div><p>That manual is worth a second look. Not only does it contain detailed-and well-illustrated instructions on maintenance and disassembly of the model, and information about the DCC decoder and sounds, but also some information about the real-life prototype. I don't know if manuals like this are standard for higher-priced scale models, but if they're not, they should be.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/17/gallery/img_0504-1.jpg" data-size="4032x3024" data-gall="galleryGroup-4"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/17/gallery/img_0504-1-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540"></a></figure></div></div><p>A slice of foam covers the model itself, which is embedded in a cradle of transparent plastic.

It's a smooth, quiet runner with nice-looking directional lights and a great sound setup. The loco responds well to controller signals, the sound plays smoothly without stutters or cutoffs.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Southern Rail Models have delivered a beautiful model, with an absolutely stunning level of detail and great build quality. It was clearly done with a lot of love for the prototype, and definitely worth its price and the wait. I wish I could afford a second one to create a double-header setup, which is very common with these locos in real life. Unfortunately, at this time I just can't do that. In the meantime, this one can make the rounds with some QR coal hoppers (also from Southern Rail).</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/17/gallery/img_0518.jpg" data-size="4032x3024" data-gall="galleryGroup-14"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/17/gallery/img_0518-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540"></a></figure></div></div><p></p><p></p><p></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__tag"><h3>Tagged in:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/tags/locos/">Locos</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee5c2941d2997b864e9173c270513a0c?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" height="240" width="240" alt="Alex"><div><h3><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/authors/alex/" class="invert" rel="author">Alex</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><div><strong>You should also read:</strong></div><div class="posts"><article><header><time datetime="2021-07-02T11:46" class="date">2 July 2021</time><h2><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/a-look-at-the-sds-models-nr-class-nr52-kungara-mankurpa/">A look at the SDS Models NR Class NR52 &#x27;Kungara Mankurpa&#x27;</a></h2></header><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/a-look-at-the-sds-models-nr-class-nr52-kungara-mankurpa/" class="image fit"><img src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/36/img_3669-scaled.jpg" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/36/responsive/img_3669-scaled-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/36/responsive/img_3669-scaled-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/36/responsive/img_3669-scaled-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/36/responsive/img_3669-scaled-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/36/responsive/img_3669-scaled-xl.jpg 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="1440" width="2560" alt=""></a><p></p><p></p><p>I don't usually write at length about new models that I acquire.
