The scale was TT (1:120), a scale that was popular in East Germany and still is in Eastern Europe, but has niche status pretty much elsewhere.</p><p>I had a decent amount of track material, some rolling stock and even a few signals and such. However, I lacked the space and the money to do anything meaningful with it. So it all ended up in boxes and eventually got sold.</p><p>Fast-forward a few decades, when my wife decided to get me started on the hobby again for my round birthday. We had been talking about building a model railway as a long-term project (which it realistically always is). She splurged a bit, and after some consideration, I ended up with a Hornby DCC starter train set, an additional Loco and extra track material. We set aside the spare room, which isn't huge, but big enough to house a beginner-sized layout. At first, I played around with the stuff on two old office desks, but the time soon came where that wouldn't do.</p><p>So here we are, and in this blog I will, over time, write about all kinds of experiences and thoughts I've had while tinkering with model railways. If you'd like to come along for the ride, be my guest.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__tag"><h3>Tagged in:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/tags/general/">General</a></li><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/tags/musings/">Musings</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee5c2941d2997b864e9173c270513a0c?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" height="240" width="240" alt="Alex"><div><h3><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/authors/alex/" class="invert" rel="author">Alex</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><div><strong>You should also read:</strong></div><div class="posts"><article><header><time datetime="2020-08-24T19:27" class="date">24 August 2020</time><h2><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/the-new-train-room-beginnings/">The New Train Room: Beginnings</a></h2></header><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/the-new-train-room-beginnings/" class="image fit"><img src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/30/img_2892-1-scaled.jpg" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/30/responsive/img_2892-1-scaled-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/30/responsive/img_2892-1-scaled-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/30/responsive/img_2892-1-scaled-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/30/responsive/img_2892-1-scaled-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/30/responsive/img_2892-1-scaled-xl.jpg 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="1440" width="2560" alt=""></a><p></p><p></p><p>It was always sort of planned that at some point, our model trains would move elsewhere. The room we used until now is quite small, and while we managed to maximise space usage in it, actually working in there was not a lot of fun. There was no room for a proper workbench, and generally things were quite cramped. We wanted the room freed up for other purposes, too.</p><p></p><ul class="actions special"><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/the-new-train-room-beginnings/" class="button">Full Story</a></li></ul></article></div></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Â© Alex Hempel 2018-2025.
