The small storage area in the foot of the (reverse) L is really just that - an area to park trains that aren't currently in use. The green circle will contain a scenic feature, and one of the ideas is to have a kind of scenic railway that operates from the elevated area to the circle, and back. Some things we are still making up as we go along.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The track plan as such is a compromise. I wanted a bigger yard area, my wife wanted more scenic stuff. At the end of the day, there's probably things we could do differently, but we'll plough ahead with this one. There is plenty to do to get it up and running - track bed, wiring, point motors, ballast, scenery. I am also planning ahead for a possible later addition of feedback and signalling, however I have some more research to do before I tackle that.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Below is a simple 3D representation of the layout, created in SCARM. I haven't added anything besides the tracks, as we are still deciding on what goes where.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/14/gallery/snapshot1.jpg" data-size="1920x961" data-gall="galleryGroup-2"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/14/gallery/snapshot1-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="360"></a></figure></div></div><p>I am currently laying the track bed and fixing the track, preparing the points for underboard motors.
