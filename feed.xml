<p>It has been five years since, in a quest to assemble a specific train, I acquired a model of an East German dining car in the then typical red Mitropa livery. At the time, I didn't really know what I had bought - only that the model had been produced in the GDR. But I was surprised at the condition of the model and the still working interior lighting. Subsequently I learned a bit more about the providence of it.</p>

<p>It has been five years since, in a quest to assemble a specific train, I acquired a model of an East German dining car in the then typical red Mitropa livery. At the time, I didn't really know what I had bought - only that the model had been produced in the GDR. But I was surprised at the condition of the model and the still working interior lighting. Subsequently I learned a bit more about the providence of it.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The model had been made by East German company Schicht, which had been founded in 1947 in Dresden and focused on the production of model railway rolling stock. Interestingly, Schicht was a precursor to Piko. The heritage of Schicht lived on in models made by Sachsenmodelle and later Tillig.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Over the years I picked up a number of different models here and there, a surprising few of them here in Australia. My first few purchases were of varying condition - it's not unusual for certain parts, like buffers and door steps, to be missing, as it doesn't take much to damage those. As I learned more about these models, I started paying attention to their condition. as well. While it's not a dealbreaker, the price I will pay for one of these is commensurate to how well preserved the model is.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The models, made in the 60s and early 70s, before Schicht was rolled into Prefo and then Piko, don't really make you think they could be that old. Their detail level is high, the print quality is astounding, and pretty much the only giveaway is their length, which is scaled to 1:100, something quite common for the time: models were shortened in scale to work better in tighter curves. With the advent of close coupler mechanisms, prototypical length carriages became more viable on small layouts.One little detail I really love is the route signs present on most of the models. With the exception of the CSD sleeping carriage they all show the same route: Berlin - Prague. A great pretext to tell a little story.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My intent is to run at least some of these in a train. Most of these are equipped with interior lighting, but they use old style incandescent lightbulbs and flicker a LOT on DCC track. Upgrading to LED with a buffer to eliminate flickering will be a must. Thankfully these models are very easy to disassemble. This will be an upcoming project and therefore become my first fully lit train.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My first acquisition, as mentioned above, was this model of a dining car type Wr 4g of the MITROPA. It was overall in good condition, with working lights and all parts present, and only a minor nick on the roof. The interior is quite detailed for the time, even sporting small table lamps.I have a soft spot for these red dining cars, and none of my East German express trains are complete without one.</p>

<p>Some time later I bought small lot of these models from an Australian seller, all passenger cars of the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR). At the time I didn't know everything I know now, so these carriages are in very mixed condition. Most buffers and a few of the steps are missing, but at least all the models were clean. There is a good chance I may use the postal car in a train composition, but the rest will live on the shelf. The second dining carriage will probably only serve as a spares donor.</p>

<p>Another local find was this DR mixed class car type ABme, which I got dirt cheap, but it looks accordingly, with not only a few missing bits but a fair amount of dirt. This one will not run in any train, it's simply too dilapidated for that. But I will use it as a test bed for LED installation and other modifications. I do wish I could find another ABme, but so far I have not been so lucky.</p>

<p>One might think that's all one is able to get, considering these models are well over 40 years old and would at some point have been shipped halfway across the world. But I would soon learn otherwise. The next local find was two carriages of former Czechoslovak state railway operator CSD, both in very good condition, clean and with all parts present. Looking at these models you'd hardly believe they were made in the 1970s. Both of these will definitely run in a train.</p>

<p>And then, on a trip to Germany, I picked up two more Bme cars from a model railway exchange. Again these were in great condition with working lights and no breakage - much better than the first Bme I got. Which again makes them prime candidates for active duty.</p>

<p>And yet another local find was this Ame, which utterly surprised me. Not only was the model itself in <strong>pristine</strong> condition - it looked like it had never been taken out of the box - but the box was also almost like new. Most of the time, when you do get these models in their boxes, the boxes are quite worn and sometimes tatty. Not so this one - you'd have a hard time believing it was more than ten years old, never mind over 40.</p>

<p>And the most recent addition to this particular collection was another dining carriage, this time of the CSD. I discovered this one at a local second hand trader, and aside from one missing step the model is in good condition. One of the lightbulbs had come loose internally, and since the lighting fixture as a whole looked a bit worn, I removed it entirely. That also gave me the impetus to start thinking about how to upgrade these models to LED lights, a project I will embark on soon.</p>

<p>There are still a fair few models out there I'd like to add to the collection, even if they won't run. There are models representing Polish and Hungarian rolling stock, as well as different East German liveries. It may behoove me to also acquire a catalogue of what actually existed. An online find of a later Piko catalogue gives a bit of an idea - it even still uses the same item numbers - but it's by far not the full view.</p>

<p>Some time ago I took delivery of my first batch of signals. These are generic 3-light signals made in China. They aren't particularly prototypical - the aspects resemble a type of signal used here in Queensland, as well as some European signals. But the looks are very basic. However, for first experiments and wrapping my head around the subject matter, they are more than sufficient.</p>

<p>Some time ago I took delivery of my first batch of signals. These are generic 3-light signals made in China. They aren't particularly prototypical - the aspects resemble a type of signal used here in Queensland, as well as some European signals. But the looks are very basic. However, for first experiments and wrapping my head around the subject matter, they are more than sufficient.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Of course I wanted to control them digitally, like everything else on my layout. As detailed in my post about servos for point control, I am using Arduino-based hardware and software provided by Dutch railway modeller Nico Teering under the name <a href="http://www.arcomora.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ArCoMoRa</a>. Nico provides the DCCNext, basically a custom Arduino made for controlling model railway accessories. It can be set up with two different software options: MarDec for controlling standard accessories such as lights, point motors and similar; and ArSigDec, which is made specifically for controlling light signals with more complex aspects. Since I was already using MarDec, it made sense to give ArSigDec a whirl.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>LED-based signals are usually equipped with a resistor allowing for them to be used with a specific voltage range. The signals I acquired are meant to be used with 9-12V. Since I was intending to use 5V provided by the DCCNext for the use of LEDs, I was prepared to change the resistor as recommended by the vendor, but a quick test with the signal on 5V showed that that wasn't necessary - the LEDs were bright enough with that voltage.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Setting up the signals on ArSigDec was quite easy. The text-based interface is easy to use and an explanation for all options is always at hand. The software offers a number of standard signals, mainly European ones, which can simply be selected from a database. If that's not sufficient, custom signals with up to 8 LEDs can be defined. Unlike MarDec, you can't set up the decoder ports used by a signal - the first defined signal will use the first available ports starting from port 1, the second signal will use the next available ports, and so on.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I initially used the built-in UK standard signal with 3 lights and 3 aspects - the closest equivalent to these signals. That all worked fine when only testing with the DCCNext. However, the confusion started when I wanted to use my DCC central to configure and control the signal.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My new central, the ESU ECoS with built-in touchscreen, allows for the creation of a full track plan. Signals and other objects can be linked in the track plan and fully controlled from there. The ECoS has a limited number of predefined light signal types, as well as a generic light signal with up to 4 aspects. I picked one that was closest to the ones I am using - but the aspects were all wrong. While green was showing on my track plan, the signal actually showed red - and the yellow aspect didn't work at all.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It took me a minute to wrap my head around this - well, actually I had to sleep over it. The following part of this post dives a bit deeper into the setting up of signal aspects on DCC.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Every DCC accessory gets its own address. Possible addresses are between 1 and 2044. Each accessory address can have two states, often referred to as red and green. This is most understandable when looking at a point, which can be either straight (red) or thrown (green).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When setting up a light signal on DCC, each accessory address can handle two aspects - one on red, one on green. A signal is commonly set up with a base address - this address handles the first two configured signal aspects. If a signal has more than two aspects configured, the accessory decoder automatically assigns the next address from the chosen base address. So if the base address is 1, then the first two aspects are handled by that address, the next two are configured under address 2, and so on.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>ArSigDec assigns the aspects as follows:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Aspect 1 = Base address Green</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Aspect 2 = Base address Red</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Aspect 3 = Base address + 1 Green</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Aspect 4 = Base address + 1 Red</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What I eventually figured out is that the ECoS flips the aspect assignment. For aspect 1, it sends the red command, for aspect 2 the green command, and so on. Unfortunately the aspects themselves and their switching order are fixed in the ECoS and can't be freely configured. For the chosen 3-aspect signal, aspect 1 is the green light, aspect 2 is the red light, aspect 3 is yellow.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This means the configuration has to be done properly in the signal decoder - which may render some of the available standard signal configurations useless when using the ECoS. Ultimately, the aspects have to be matched like this:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>ECoS aspect 1 --&gt; ArSigDec aspect 2</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>ECoS aspect 2 --&gt; ArSigDec aspect 1</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>ECoS aspect 3 --&gt; ArSigDec aspect 4</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>ECoS aspect 4 --&gt; ArSigDec aspect 3</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This posed little difficulty once I had figured out this mapping. However, since I am using a signal with three aspects, I had to tinker a bit more, since an ECoS 3-aspect signal and an ArSigDec 3-aspect signal would never match up.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The solution was to create a 3-aspect signal in the ECoS, but a 4-aspect signal in ArSigDec. For the latter, the third aspect becomes a phantom aspect - it will never be active, so I configure it to turn off all LEDs. Aspect 4 is then the actual aspect 3 as shown in the ECoS.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The fun bit came in when I wanted to use the track route functionality of the ECoS to set the signals based on the state of the route. I installed two of these signals on a mainline and siding. There already are two track routes set up in my ECoS track plan, which set both the entry and exit point of the siding to match, so that a train can pass through either the mainline or the siding. All I had to do was to add the desired state of each signal to the track routes - it couldn't be easier.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the meantime, I have received my first two signals based on German prototypes. I was able to apply the learnings from the generic signals to these, and it took me considerably little time to set them up and make them operational. They are specced for operation with 10-16V AC or 14-24V DC, but again, 5V make them light up enough for my purposes. The below clip shows the signals in action.</p>

And by 'things', I am mainly referring to certain brands that are likely to be mentioned and recommended when someone asks the aforementioned question.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Before I get into the meat of that, let me lay a bit of groundwork. A modern DCC system, even at entry level, should have the following features (over and above the general capability to, well, run trains):</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A <strong>programming track</strong> is where you position your trains to make changes to its configuration. This may not be front and centre for a beginner, but it won't be long until you need to familiarise yourself with this topic. Having a dedicated programming track is useful because it is configured to use lower voltage, and you avoid accidentally writing config to the wrong train. While it is possible to do programming without a dedicated programming track, it comes with its own drawbacks and restrictions. These days, very few command stations (including entry-level offerings) do not have a dedicated programming track output.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Computer connectivity</strong> serves a few purposes: firmware or software updates, controlling trains and layouts using external software, or at times providing a more convenient interface for configuring the command central itself. There are very few command stations out there nowadays that don't have a computer connection, usually via USB but sometimes via a network connection.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A <strong>feedback bus</strong> becomes relevant when you want to use a computer to control and automate your model railway. Specialised software uses feedbacks to determine where on your layout your trains currently are, and uses that information to control them. Going into in-depth detail would make this piece considerably longer than it already is, so let it suffice to say that if the idea of making your trains run across your layout by themselves appeals to you, a usable feedback bus is something you absolutely need. Common options are LocoNet, XPressNet (sometimes known as X-Bus or R-Bus), S88 or CAN. A wide range of accessories is available for these bus systems.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Short circuit protection</strong> is simply a must. Short circuits can seriously damage your trains and digital gear (and worse). It's not a question of <strong>if</strong> you will experience a short circuit, but <strong>when</strong>. All it takes is for a train to derail over a point. So the digital system needs to detect when a short circuit is happening, and turn off the track power immediately.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With that out of the way, let's talk about a few digital system brands that you should simply put, avoid, even if recommended to you in the most glorifying way. These brands are: Hornby, MRC/Gaugemaster, and NCE.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Hornby produce the Elite controller, a system that actually looks pretty cool with its colour screen and twin control dials. It ticks all the above boxes in theory - but it is badly supported, unstable, and the entire product line appears to be abandoned. Those are enough reasons to skip past it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Which might take you to MRC and it UK counterpart Gaugemaster, and you might as well keep skipping. The legacy MRC Prodigy system, sold in Europe under the Gaugemaster brand, is an insular solution lacking a feedback bus, and while it has computer connectivity, it is not supported by most of the software you'll find out there. Gaugemaster have also recently released their own Infinity product line, with the bold claim that it "delivers not what design engineers think you need but what modellers know it needs". Which is utterly laughable given the fact that it lacks a feedback bus and <strong>deliberately omits</strong> a computer interface. If all you want is to control trains with a handheld unit, this might suffice, but perish any thought of extensibility or interoperability.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And that takes us to a brand I am going to single out a bit. I am on record for most of the following, and it continues to be a hill I am willing to die on:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>As a DCC beginner in 2024, steer clear of NCE.</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>North Coast Engineering, or NCE, are a US manufacturer of DCC equipment, including command stations, decoders and all manner of accessories. NCE is also one of the most frequently recommended brands when people ask the question that I elaborated on in Pt 1. So I am going to reiterate what I said before: steer clear of this brand. This is not a joke. If you're a DCC beginner in the year 2024 and beyond, there is <strong>zero </strong>reason for you to consider a digital system made by NCE. Absolutely <strong>none</strong>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The NCE PowerCab, NCE's entry-level offering since at least 2006, is a particularly egregious case. It is a system stuck on a technical level from 15 years ago, the ecosystem has not seen any significant additions or updates in the same time. By today's standards it is underpowered and lacks features. Yet you are likely to hear people talk about it as if it were the best thing since sliced bread, and tell you it'll be the only thing you'll ever need. Particularly, its fans praise its affordability, ease of use, and extensibility. I am an erstwhile PowerCab user myself, and I can tell you that most of those claims are either vastly exaggerated, or simply bunkum. Fans will also talk about the robustness, reliability and customer support of NCE and its products. You won't hear me argue that particular point, but long-lived, well supported products are not unique to NCE either.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ease of use is distinctly a matter of taste personally, I found the PowerCab to be neither particularly intuitive, nor easy or fun to use. It's a bulky unit that may not feel nice to hold or operate especially one-handed. It has some idiosyncrasies, such as its locomotive recall function (instead of an actual locomotive database), and its unintuitive point control (indicating 1 and 2 for the state of a point), both of which are likely to throw beginners, and frequently made me scratch my head. Controlling points, accessing decoder functions beyond the number 9, or even basic programming actions, are exercises in memorising sequences of button presses. The 2-line display is of low information density, and the majority of handheld controllers available these days has got much better displays.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Now I should throw in here that, in particular, programming is not the forte of almost any hand controller I've seen in action. It's simply too complex a matter to be able to do with what is effectively a number pad with a few extra buttons. Using an app or dedicated software almost always beats using a handheld controller.</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As far as extensibility goes, the claim that the PowerCab is easy to expand is simply misleading. It's no more or less expandable than the majority of systems out there. You can add boosters, throttles, and certain other devices for the Cab Bus. This is par for the course for virtually any system out there, and many of them uses bus systems that are way easier to configure than the Cab Bus. It is not a system that will easily grow with you - at some point you'll brush up against its limitations, and then it's a case of either spending a lot of money on effectively turning your PowerCab into a PowerPro - or just buying a better system.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The PowerCab lacks <strong>all</strong> of the above mentioned features out of the box. Every single one. You have to pay extra to get any of them. You need a separate gadget to get computer connectivity, another one for a programming track output, and yet another one for good short circuit protection.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>NCE provide a so-called USB interface which connects to their bus and basically acts like a throttle, but it is not as well implemented as a properly integrated connection could be. To get a programming track, you used to have to jury-rig something yourself or buy the Auto_SW, a since discontinued gadget. Recently, NCE have released a new product called the PowerCab Partner, a device which combines the aforementioned USB interface and a dedicated programming track output. I suppose that some credit is due, but again, where has that been for the last ten years or so?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The PowerCab's short circuit protection is so hopelessly inadequate it shouldn't even be called that. When the PowerCab detects a short circuit, it will go into a start/stop cycle until you physically unplug it. There is no clear indication that a short circuit has been detected. So it can take anyone a few seconds to a) realise what's happening and b) take the appropriate action. This allows for the short circuit to happen repeatedly, increasing the potential for damage. You can buy separate circuit breakers - or go for a system where that isn't necessary.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now, the PowerCab does have a feedback bus. But you're be very restricted as to what, or rather, how much you can do. NCE produces the Auxiliary Input Unit (AIU), with which feedbacks can be implemented on the PowerCab. However, due to restrictions of the PowerCab specifically, you are limited to a maximum of five AIUs, which gives you at most 70 individual feedbacks. This may be enough for a small layout, but with anything larger or more complex, you're very likely to need more than that. To compare, common feedback bus systems implemented in many other command stations support between 512 and 4096 individual feedbacks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Lastly, what makes a feedback bus usable is not only its existence, but the availability of feedback modules for it, and in that regard, the Cab Bus is just not up to snuff. Aside from the NCE AIU, no other feedback modules are available for the PowerCab. Meanwhile, if you have a command station with a more widespread bus system, you're able to get matching accessories from other manufacturers, and in some cases, you can even build them yourself.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Note: the high-end NCE offerings revolving around the PowerPro have most of these features built in. Sadly that does not make them any more up-to-date, it just puts them on par with virtually any other offering at most price levels.</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Of course this puts a dent into the affordability. By itself the PowerCab may be cheaper, but by the time you've added all of the above, you're almost always better off opting for a different system.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So to summarise a long read, one more time: if you're starting out with DCC in 2024 or beyond, you have no reason whatsoever to consider the NCE PowerCab as a command central. It has nothing to offer that you can't get elsewhere, and most alternatives have better implementations, better software support, or are simply nicer to use. The only reason to go for NCE is if you're going with your gut and it has tweaked your 'I bet that's fun to use' instinct more than the alternatives.</p>

<p>So you've decided to get into model railways. Congratulations and welcome to the fold. It's a beautiful hobby that can be practised in many different ways, and all of them are equally valid.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You've probably already read a bit about Digital Command Control, or DCC, and maybe you've already decided to go for it. If you're still wondering if you should let me make the decision easier for you: yes, you want DCC. Unless you're planning to run one single train on a simple oval around your Christmas tree, DCC can only benefit you. And that's despite its learning curve.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So now you're well on your way to the next question, and it is possibly one of the most asked questions by any DCC beginner, in any given forum:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Which digital system should I get?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Depending on location, place of discourse and other factors, the terms command station, command central, digital system or digital controller may be used interchangeably. We are talking about the device that makes your trains go. Buying one of these is something that should be considered thoroughly, as there are a multitude of options in all price classes, catering to different requirements and tastes. Navigating these options while trying to understand what you need can be all kinds of daunting.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This question is asked in virtually any model railway related forums with unshakeable regularity, and just as regularly people will instinctively answer with a recommendation for the system they know, like and/or prefer. This is fraught with peril, as different people have different preferences. If all you ever know is a single system, you can't really know if other systems might be more suitable to what the person asking the questions wants to do. Given the different aspects above, it's hard for a beginner to know what you want or don't want to do off the bat - but you probably want to keep your options open until you can confidently make a decision.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Some people will tell you to get what your local club has, or what is most common in your market. A reason often given is that this way you'll have people who know the system and can help you with it. I sincerely invite you to studiously ignore this particular piece of advice. Seriously, disregard it, unless you're planning to spend disproportionately more time in such a club than with your own layout and setup. A club has vastly different requirements from a home layout, their layouts tend to be bigger and cater for multiple simultaneous operators. At home you'll likely be the only or at least main operator, and so you're better off buying what works for you. Few things will sour your model railway hobby more than a command station you actively dislike because it doesn't cater to your preferences.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>From my own experience, the best advice I can give you is: follow your instincts. Look around what's available. Something is bound to catch your eye, and you'll think "oh, this looks nice", or "that seems like it'll be fun to use". The <strong>best thing</strong> you can do <strong>in that moment</strong> is to home in on that option - research it, figure out the pros and cons, and if there's nothing massively speaking against it - go with it. It may be that you pick an expensive system, but going through cheaper systems one by one to figure out the hard way what you <em>don't</em> like isn't going to be much cheaper in the end. It may be that you pick a system which has a lot of features you might not use initially - that's fine, overkill is deeply underrated. And it's better to have and not need than the other way round.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When I first looked at getting into DCC, I researched available command stations, and one option immediately jumped out at me: the ESU ECoS. It simply looked like something I wanted to use. But at the time I could neither afford it nor justify the expense. I started out with a Hornby eLink - a small computer interface included with a starter set. It had software included and got me started, but that was about it. I next got an NCE PowerCab, for the main reason that it was the most recommended system out here. As can be read <a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/2019/02/17/out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new/" data-type="post" data-id="302">elsewhere</a>, that didn't last either. My next step was a black box central, the DR5000, which enabled app control. I went with that for quite some time, but due to some ongoing niggling problems as well as my increased dislike for app control, I ultimately decided to throw money at the problem and went with my original preference. And now I ask myself why I hadn't done that from the start.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm not going to go and tell anyone that they should get an ECoS. It's a big upfront expense, and a pricey ecosystem to be in. Some people dislike its fixed, dashboard-like nature and prefer the freedom of movement that comes with a wireless hand-held controller. Many people like controlling their trains with an app - I personally don't, I prefer having my eye on the train and my hand on a physical control dial. Again, here is where everyone has to figure out what works for them, and sometimes it will take several attempts at that. Your first command station does not have to be your last one (but it would be great if it could be).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You may ask: which options should I consider? So here is a <strong>non-exhaustive</strong> list of currently available command stations that are modern and expandable, at different price levels, in no particular order (note: some of these links are in German):</p>

<p>Once again, the best advice I can give you, that anyone should give you, is to use your guts. Figure out what you like, then go from there. If you're going to are fortunate enough to have a model train shop close by where you might be able to try out at least one or two available system, that might help, but not everyone is so lucky, and telling good shops from bad shops is another matter entirely. Your instincts are your best guide. Good luck out there, and if this wasn't enough to keep you busy for a spell, part II goes into a bit more depth and talks about what to avoid.</p>

<p>Yes, it's been a while. Again. You have my permission to chuckle. Amidst webserver woes and general life challenges I have not had the time or energy to post, much less make significant progress with my model train setup.</p>

<p>But that doesn't mean that nothing has happened in the past two years. I've renewed my control setup, made some tweaks to make trains move more smoothly and consistently, and when nothing else helped, well, I got some new trains.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So let's start with those, at least the latest additions (otherwise this post will take me the whole year to finish).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For something a bit different, a key addition to the fleet this year was the South Australian Railways 900 class. This was the first mainline diesel locomotive built in Australia for an Australian railway operator. 10 units were built between 1951 and 1953, and despite the shape, these were not license builds of American units. Instead they were designed from scratch by SAR, and equipped with motors, generators and traction motors by English Electric. The model by SDS Models leaves little to be desired, it is exquisitely detailed and the sound is lots of fun.</p>

<p>There is no rolling stock for this loco yet - SDS have announced matching passenger cars which I am waiting and saving up for.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The second significant addition is another model from SDS - the 81 Class diesel locomotive of the New South Wales State Rail Authority. I've had a hankering for the colourful original livery of these locos - nicknamed 'Candy', and the previously acquired NLBX banana vans were a great period fit as well. This loco too is nicely detailed and comes with great sound.</p>

<p>Lastly, I've finally gotten around to get loads for the RQTY container wagons I've had for quite some time now. A while ago I got a single container just to check the fit and looks, but that wasn't enough. Fun fact, Australian model manufacturer On Track Models have produced several runs of - again - period-appropriate 40ft curtain-sided containers with a variety of motifs. In one of the earlier runs there were advertising graphics of some Australian products which tickled my fancy, and even though they were largely sold out, I managed to get my hands on a few, namely the containers advertising peanut butter, Vegemite, and laundry liquid.</p>

<p>To fill the gaps on the 63ft container wagons, a bunch of 20ft container models from Auscision came into the fold. Yes, the overall base colour is blue, but that wasn't too much of a bother to me. Most other variations from those production runs were sold out, and new runs will take some time.</p>

The ECoS has now been in poeration for over a year and I can say I've never been happier with my controls. The form factor combining a versatile touch screen with physical speed controllers and function buttons is near perfect for me.<br>

<p>Also, as a real life highlight, I travelled on the world famous Ghan from Adelaide to Darwin. In the course of that trip I finally got to see the mighty NR class up close. Also, I visited the Adelaide Railway Museum which, among other things, exhibits one of three remaining exemplars of the 900 Class locomotive - an absolutely impressive machine.</p>

<p>As for future plans, I mainly want to spend more time in the train room. I've gained some momentum over the holidays and completed some experiments that will help me move forward with signals and feedback automation. Landscaping is pretty high on the list too, but that will be very slow and steady. The static grass applicator is already on the shelf.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As far as this blog goes, there will also be some necessary changes. I've already moved my video hosting to Peertube (still using Youtube as a backup) and am going to link to those videos going forward. The blog backend itself will also change. Wordpress has gone all in on generative AI, which I personally abhor and don't want anywhere near my texts and media. As I am self-hosting now, I have more control and flexibility, so I will be trying out some alternative options soon. If this site looks completely different some day soon, you know what happened.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Lastly, of course, there will be more trains. And I'll close this post with a quick clip of two of my favourite freight trains: the container train and the banana train.</p>

<p>Well over two years ago, I wrote about the <a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/2019/02/17/point-motor-shoot-out-final/" data-type="post" data-id="307">conclusion of my quest to find point motors</a>. At the time, the Cobalt motors became the solution of choice. But of course, that couldn't have been the end of it.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Why not? Because a bigger layout was always in the cards. And while the Cobalts were a good solution at the time, that solution wasn't going to scale well. Due to a unit price of now $50 Australian ($37.50 if bought in a set of 12), they are simply very costly. Once I had determined the new track plan, with a grand total of 31 points, I gulped twice and shelved the idea of buying more of these motors.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Or any other bespoke point motors, for that matter. There are a few options, but none of them are suitable for people with small budgets, at least not in quantities. With time, the solution became more obvious: servos.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The SG90 servo is ubiquitous, affordable, and has a good reputation. Decoder options for operating servos are numerous, and ranging from very affordable to luxurious. Servos are strong enough to throw points with over-centre springs, something the Cobalts couldn't do. This has advantages and drawbacks - the spring guarantees a snug alignment of the point's end positions, but leaving it in place sacrifices the slow, smooth point movement.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But there are a few more things to consider when using servos. Where bespoke motors are built specifically to be mounted below board or next to railway track, servos are more universal and therefore need mounts suited for the intended purpose. Bespoke motors usually come either with built-in digital capability, or are operated by regular accessory decoders. Servos on the other hand, due to the way they operate with PWM pulses on the signal connector, need specific decoders to be operated.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I researched all those things at length before I took the plunge. Some manufacturers offer servo decoders as part of their range, but there are also a number of homebrew solutions. I ended up going with a familiar option. In previously conducted <a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/2020/06/30/feedback-experiments-pt-ii/" data-type="post" data-id="606">feedback experiments</a> I used the ArLoco shield provided by the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.arcomora.com/" target="_blank">ArCoMoRa project</a>. The same project also makes the Mardec software, another Arduino-based solution for the control of accessories and LEDs. This software, like the ArLoco, works with a custom Arduino shield, but it can also be used with the ArCoMoRa DCCNext decoder. That decoder is effectively an all-in-one solution using the ATMEGA328P chip and a custom circuit. One DCCNext can control up to 12 servos, which is a darn sight more cost-effective than most bespoke servo controllers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For the mount, it was mostly a case of exploring well-known 3D printing sites, and I <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3603598" target="_blank">found a mount</a> that looked suitable and had informative pictures with it. I do not own a 3D printer, but a friend of mine printed a whole stack of these mounts for me, enough to cover all my planned points and have a few spares. The mounts came out great, the SG90 servos fit very snugly.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As far as the throw wires are concerned, a number of different opinions can be found. The Cobalt motors use piano wire or spring steel wire, and some people recommend using the same for servos. These throw wires have a bit of flexibility and therefore exert more force on the tie bar, keeping the blades securely in their end position. Others say that it is sufficient to use regular steel or even brass wire, as long as it is stiff enough. For starters, I decided to experiment with straightened paper clips - that kind of steel wire is not springy, but easy enough to bend into shape.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Installing these servos is reasonably easy, but with the track already in place it requires partial track removal. First I mark out the centre position of the tie bar. After removal of the point, a 10mm hole is drilled through the base board. The servo mount is installed centre-on below that hole, and the throw wire is guided through the hole. Lastly, the point is replaced with the throw wire going through the tie bar centre hole.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There was a small snag though. Due to the shape of the mounts, it isn't easy to tell whether it is centred in relation to the hole in the baseboard - at least not unless you can be both above and below the table at the same time. Since I tend to stick the mounts in place with double-sided tape, I needed an aid. After trying a few things, I combined a push pin and a 10mm plastic wall plug (normally used to anchor screws in masonry). This centring aid is guided through the hole from the bottom. The fulcrum hole in the servo mount then goes onto the pin. Once everything is in place, the centring aid is removed from the top before reinstalling the point. This has worked very well in the installs I've done so far.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With the DCCNext decoder, I had the option to connect all three servo pins directly to the decoder, or to only connect the signal wire, while feeding the servos from a separate 5V bus. I opted for the latter, because it makes wiring somewhat easier. The 5V bus has to go around most of the layout anyway, so feeder wires from the bus to the servos will be quite short. The signal wires appear to be able to handle some length - 4m of wire salvaged from a Cat5 network cable between the servo and the controller have been issue-free so far.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first thing I noticed after installing a few servos and operating them was how utterly quiet they are. The Cobalts always made an ungodly noise when switching, which was usually amplified by the baseboard and could even be heard over the running noise of trains. The servos make barely a sound, certainly nothing that will be heard once trains are going. That almost makes it useful to leave the centre springs in place, since their snap gives a bit of an audible confirmation that the point has actually switched.</p>

<p>Another year has gone by, and while this blog was offline for part of it, sufficient things have happened in the train room this year. The layout has made progress to the point where we can at least run trains, and there have been a fair few rolling stock additions.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Let's start with those.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first addition of the year (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/2022/02/03/a-late-2021-retrospective/" data-type="post" data-id="924" target="_blank">not counting the BR 220 which was a 2021 Christmas present but arrived late</a>) was a set of four passenger carriages of the type Y/B, as operated by Deutsche Reichsbahn in the 1980s. These carriages were a perfect fit for my BR 132, and they were so cheap that I could not walk past them. The set of 3, consisting of a 1st class carriage, a mixed class carriage and a 2nd class carriage (with sleeper compartment), would have cost over $300 Australian. The extra carriage is a somewhat rare Salon car which would have been used in charter trains and other special consists, not something you would have seen regularly. I got all four carriages for $150, which was an absolute bargain considering they were basically new.</p>

</div></div>
<p>But while three is a crowd, four carriages do not make a train. Hence, more carriages needed to be acquired. This happened in the form of another set of the same brand, which arrived as a Christmas present. This set includes two more 2nd class coaches and a dining car – I just love the red Mitropa carriages.</p>

</div></div>
<p>A cool detail I noticed about the coaches is that they have smoking and non-smoking compartments, as would have been common at the time. And the seats in these compartments had different colours – reddish brown for non-smoking, dark green for smoking. This detail has been reproduced in the models.<br><br>The following video shows the BR 132 hauling all seven carriages. In normal operation, I will likely reduce this to 5, and swap carriages in and out. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">Further additions have been made to the Australian fleet. For one, a second X200 has been added. The IDR X200 is a fine model of a small railway tractor as used in New South Wales in the 1960s. But due to its small size and low weight, it is very susceptible to losing power, especially on DCC. Also due to its small size, it’s not easy to add a power pack or keepalive. The process is described online, but I did not feel confident in doing it myself. However, IDR Models offer the installation of a keepalive as a reasonably priced service, so early in the year I had the first X200 upgraded this way. The result was so impressive that we wanted to get a second one – they will be used for small, fictional freight trains. With the keepalive charged, the loco will keep running for up to 10 seconds after losing power, and the light stays on for over 30 seconds.</figure>

<p>The other new loco for this year was a bit of an impulse buy. There was appetite for something a bit different than what we already had. Also, since the X200s are nicknamed after my wife and daughter, there was cause for having a loco nicknamed after me. This loco materialised in the shape of a Victorian Railways B Class. This type was the first mainline diesel locomotive to be built for the Victorian broad gauge network. It was also the first EMD-licensed dual cab locomotive, and the design was later used in the popular European Nohab locomotives used by Scandinavian operators.<br><br>Our B Class is B65 in a promotional livery advertising Australian model train manufacturer Auscision. The real loco was given this livery in 2007 and wears it to this day, although it has been permanently withdrawn from service due to serious mechanical problems. Below are a few detail pictures, and a video demonstrating the model’s sound. At the time of shooting the video, there was a small glitch where the engine started moving while the motor was still ‘spooling up’. In the meantime I have updated the decoder’s software, and since then the model is behaving correctly.</p>

<p>The final addition for the year was another somewhat exotic selection. In the mid 1990s, a class of louvre vans was constructed specifically for the transport of bananas in New South Wales. These wagons, called NLBX, were in service with the now defunct Banana Grower's Federation. While not a lot of information can be found online, it appears certain that they could be found in several colours, and no two vans looked completely alike, as there were differences in signage and lines. These vans were produced as H0 models by On Track Models, and I managed to rustle up two of the last sets still available in the wild. They look great, and among the six wagons out of two sets, no two look alike.</p>

<p>The following video shows all six NLBX being hauled by B65. This is not fully prototypical, as the NLBX vans went out of service in the early 2000s. But according to the manufacturer, these vans operated in Victoria as well, so it is not out of the question that a B Class could have hauled them at some point - just not B65 in this livery. But you know what? It's good enough for me. In this video, you can also see that some of the vans have a yellow line going all around on one side, but only at the bottom on the other side.</p>

<p>That's 2022 as far as rolling stock acquisitions are concerned. But what else has happened?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Of the planned layout, the track for the base layer has been laid and wired up. This can now run trains. They're going in a loop, until the storage layer has been built and a traversal added. I have started operating the points with servos - this will be subject of a separate post soon. The <a href="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/building-a-programming-box-part-2/">programming box</a> has been upgraded to a point where it's really usable.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Lastly, there were two mini projects I completed last year on the spur of a moment - mini, because neither took very long. One was the addition of a collapsible shelf to the end of the middle section. This shelf is used as a space to put the laptop which is used to operate the train control software. It can also serve as a small workspace for impromptu work. For this purpose, a set of locking hinges was used. Pictures are below.</p>

<p>Today I caught two trains coming through Grandchester in opposite directions. 2315D and 2309D pulled into Grandchester station waiting for a green signal. The dual track merges into a single track at this point. At the same time, 2308D and 2321D were on their way down from the Little Liverpool Range with a full load of coal.</p>

<p>Today, I caught Aurizon's 2388D and 2313D coming through Grandchester with an empty coal train.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The voiceover is from my daughter, who delights in identifying the colour schemes of the locos. 2388D is a 'Banana' (late QR National/early Aurizon livery), 2313D an 'Eagle' (early QR National livery).</p>

<p>Truth be told... the <a href="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/building-a-programming-box-part-i/">Mk1 of the programming box</a> was always more of a proof-of-concept than an actually usable thing. It was used once or twice, but was so unwieldy that it really needed improvement.</p>

<p>Truth be told... the <a href="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/building-a-programming-box-part-i/">Mk1 of the programming box</a> was always more of a proof-of-concept than an actually usable thing. It was used once or twice, but was so unwieldy that it really needed improvement.</p>

<p>I had a few things in mind for making this contraption better, but my main pain point were the wires. They just <em>had</em> to be concealed somehow, everything else was just too ugly.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Initial attempts at creating a raised cover for the wires in the existing box were not successful. The box is just too flat to do anything meaningful, the space constraints meant that there was not enough room for the switches and connectors, and I even ended up breaking a few things. I contemplated getting a different box with the appropriate dimensions, but it wasn't a high priority, and with a slim budget there was always something else that was more urgently needed. So I kept putting off the improvements, while not using the box at all.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Until I came across another wooden box of the same kind.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Having two of those boxes gave me an idea. What if I could turn two into one? I initially thought about dismantling and reassembling the two boxes into one deeper box, in which I could then create an intermediate layer. But ultimately that seemed too complicated. I settled on a variant where I simply bolted both boxes together to form a double-lidded box. The top part contained the devices and test track as before, the bottom part was used to conceal the wires.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As for the wiring, I also moved away from my original idea of using plugs and sockets to create the required connection between programming devices, track, or decoder tester. What I started envisioning over time was this: I wanted to be able to plug power into the box, then switch on the combination of devices required for the specific task, put the loco or decoder on the track or tester, and perform the work. Power-wise, this was not a problem, because the Arduino motor shield can be powered from the same power supply as the LokProgrammer (the Arduino itself still needs USB power). My biggest concern with this setup was the remote possibility of accidentally creating a power loop and frying an expensive device.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I acquired three DPDT switches with a centre-off position. These switches are quite big and heavy. I also added a power jack matching the ESU power supply, and a LED to indicate that the box has power. The power jack is wired into the centre position of the leftmost switch, LokProgrammer and Arduino each into one of the On positions. The middle switch is the track-out, with both devices again wired into one of the On positions, and a set of wires going across to the third switch, which is also wired into the track and the decoder tester. I verified the correct power flow using a small lightbulb with a wired socket - a great little tool to have around for all kinds of quick tests. These bulbs are used for lighting up model buildings and are specified for 12-16V.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once I was happy with the switches and wiring, I connected up all the devices and tested carefully. Everything worked as expected, which surprised even me. Now I have an easy way to program and test new decoders and locomotives, it's quick to set up and pleasant to use. I still have to connect each device to USB individually, but that's not a big worry. On the Arduino motor shield, I only have the programming output wired into the track-out. If I need to test something on this device, I can send the command "&lt;1 JOIN&gt;" to make it temporarily provide main power on the programming output. That helpful advice given to me by someone on a German model railway forum saved me from wiring in yet another switch.</p>

<p>Overall, I am quite happy with Mk2 of this project.</p>
