Be it new rolling stock, technical equipment or other useful things - something always gets added. This year's haul was unexpectedly big, due to some opportunity purchases that I normally wouldn't have made, but couldn't pass up.

Opinions are split as to whether it's any good at all. In forum discussions I have read, some people defend sound in models as an addition to the perceived realism of their setups. On the other side of the table, there are those who prefer not to run with sound because it never really sounds like the real thing anyway. Then the next question often argued is how detailed and close to the original the sound has to be - or not.</p><ul class="actions special"><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/ludmilla-and-musings-about-sound/" class="button">Full Story</a></li></ul></article><article><header><time datetime="2019-09-23T09:00" class="date">23 September 2019</time><h2><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/town-planning-and-landscaping/">Town Planning and Landscaping</a></h2></header><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/town-planning-and-landscaping/" class="image fit"><img src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/24/img_1494.jpg" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/24/responsive/img_1494-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/24/responsive/img_1494-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/24/responsive/img_1494-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/24/responsive/img_1494-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/24/responsive/img_1494-xl.jpg 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="3024" width="4032" alt=""></a><p></p><p>It's been a while since the last post on this blog, and a few things have happened in the meantime.
