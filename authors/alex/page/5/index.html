But I have changed my mind on that, for two reasons. One, I have something else that I'd rather write about at this time. Two, there is a not insignificant chance that I might change to a different control software in the near future. I am already evaluating options and will see where I land, at which time I will of course report on the implementation.</p><ul class="actions special"><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/feedback-experiments-pt-ii/" class="button">Full Story</a></li></ul></article><article><header><time datetime="2020-06-22T15:38" class="date">22 June 2020</time><h2><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/feedback-experiments-pt-i/">Feedback Experiments, Pt.

We started planning for a new train room, but that had to be put on hold due to impacted finances. At the same token, because of that planning, we are not making any major changes to the current layout - it's only still up so the trains can run once in a while. We need the room it is currently in, so as soon as we can resume the work on the new train room, this one will be dismantled. A new train project had to be put on hold for a similar reason.</p><ul class="actions special"><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/feedback-experiments-pt-i/" class="button">Full Story</a></li></ul></article><article><header><time datetime="2020-01-11T15:39" class="date">11 January 2020</time><h2><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/the-holiday-haul/">The Holiday Haul</a></h2></header><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/the-holiday-haul/" class="image fit"><img src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/IMG_5112-scaled.jpg" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5112-scaled-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5112-scaled-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5112-scaled-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5112-scaled-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5112-scaled-xl.jpg 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="1208" width="2560" alt=""></a><p></p><p>The holiday season is always a good opportunity to add to the model train venture. Be it new rolling stock, technical equipment or other useful things - something always gets added.

Opinions are split as to whether it's any good at all. In forum discussions I have read, some people defend sound in models as an addition to the perceived realism of their setups. On the other side of the table, there are those who prefer not to run with sound because it never really sounds like the real thing anyway. Then the next question often argued is how detailed and close to the original the sound has to be - or not.</p><ul class="actions special"><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/ludmilla-and-musings-about-sound/" class="button">Full Story</a></li></ul></article><article><header><time datetime="2019-09-23T09:00" class="date">23 September 2019</time><h2><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/town-planning-and-landscaping/">Town Planning and Landscaping</a></h2></header><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/town-planning-and-landscaping/" class="image fit"><img src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/24/img_1494.jpg" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/24/responsive/img_1494-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/24/responsive/img_1494-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/24/responsive/img_1494-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/24/responsive/img_1494-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/24/responsive/img_1494-xl.jpg 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="3024" width="4032" alt=""></a><p></p><p>It's been a while since the last post on this blog, and a few things have happened in the meantime.
