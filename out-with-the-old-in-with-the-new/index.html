Subjects like detection, feedback and automation rear their heads as soon as you start diving deeper into the subject matter. And as I did so more and more, I couldn't stop shaking the feeling that my choice of command station was not optimal.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Sure, the PowerCab is an entry level system and priced accordingly. It's not specced for large installations, and has some constraints in terms of feedback, detection and interaction with computer software, that are not present in the high level systems. And while the PowerCab can be extended with boosters to a degree, getting past the aforementioned restrictions means you basically have to buy a new system.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Unlike many other DCC manufacturers, NCE chose not to integrate one or more of the common bus systems present in the market, like LocoNet, XPressNet or S88. Instead, they developed their own bus, called the Cab Bus, effectively turning their ecosystem into a closed one, since they are the only ones making accessories for said Cab Bus. In addition, it has been over ten years since the NCE ecosystem has last received significant technological updates, at least as far as their controllers and command stations go.</p><p></p><p></p><p>That last one is a bit of a sticky point for me. Even though the underlying tech - the DCC protocol and related standards - don't change much, it's still good to see manufacturers trying to innovate and refresh their products, instead of resting on their laurels. The fact that the NCE systems don't enjoy as much support in the software world as other manufacturers didn't exactly help either.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To make a long story less long, I got to the point where I regretted my original purchase decision and started looking for a more suitable replacement. And I found one, in the shape of the Digikeijs DR5000.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This command station has entered the market in 2016 and is positioning itself as a feature-rich but affordable option. The DR5000 integrates three of the common bus systems - LocoNet, XPressNet and S88 - and can be connected to a computer via USB or several network-based protocols. One of its selling points is that it can act like a Roco Z21, which enables the use of Z21-specific accessories and apps. There isn't a model railway control software out there that doesn't work with the DR5000 in one way or another. Also, it is specced for a maximum track output of 3 amps, which gives beginners a lot more headroom for expansion than similarly priced entry level systems.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Of course, the DR5000 doesn't come with a physical controller. It does enable the use of a number of third party cabs, which is an extra purchase. Digikeijs are also working on their own controller, but there's no ETA for it yet. The control software that ships with the station can run locos and operate accessories, so that gets you started. However, it only runs under Windows - a minor fly in the ointment.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The best bit was that I found a local reseller who carried this command station. And for once, timing worked out exceptionally well for me. I advertised the PowerCab at a bit of a loss, but got enough for it to pay for the DR5000 outright. And ever since I got that piece of tech, I'm much happier with my control setup and future prospects.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/18/gallery/img_0686.jpg" data-size="4032x3024" data-gall="galleryGroup-1" data-title="The DR5000 wired in below my table.
