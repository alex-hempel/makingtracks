The intent was to put the ceiling in next, but while putting up the first panel, we realised that the wall panels were just a few millimetres longer than the height of the wall frames, and would therefore be difficult to mount with the ceiling in place.</p><ul class="actions special"><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/the-new-train-room-a-modicum-of-progress/" class="button">Full Story</a></li></ul></article></section><footer><nav class="pagination"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/page/5/" class="previous">Previous</a> <a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/page/3/" class="next">Next</a></nav></footer></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>© Alex Hempel 2018-2025.
