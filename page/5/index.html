The last two weekends were spent painting the ceiling panels and cross beams (as well as doing a few other, unrelated things around the house - cracked drain pipes don't wait). The intent was to put the ceiling in next, but while putting up the first panel, we realised that the wall panels were just a few millimetres longer than the height of the wall frames, and would therefore be difficult to mount with the ceiling in place.</p><ul class="actions special"><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/the-new-train-room-a-modicum-of-progress/" class="button">Full Story</a></li></ul></article><article><header><time datetime="2020-08-30T14:51" class="date">30 August 2020</time><h2><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/the-new-train-room-frameworks/">The New Train Room: Frameworks</a></h2></header><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/the-new-train-room-frameworks/" class="image fit"><img src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/31/img_2922-scaled.jpg" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/31/responsive/img_2922-scaled-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/31/responsive/img_2922-scaled-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/31/responsive/img_2922-scaled-md.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" loading="lazy" height="1440" width="2560" alt=""></a><p></p><p>After a week of straight work, with a few disruptions and two trips to the hardware store, the frame for the new train room is finished.</p><ul class="actions special"><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/the-new-train-room-frameworks/" class="button">Full Story</a></li></ul></article><article><header><time datetime="2020-08-24T19:27" class="date">24 August 2020</time><h2><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/the-new-train-room-beginnings/">The New Train Room: Beginnings</a></h2></header><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/the-new-train-room-beginnings/" class="image fit"><img src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/30/img_2892-1-scaled.jpg" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/30/responsive/img_2892-1-scaled-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/30/responsive/img_2892-1-scaled-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/30/responsive/img_2892-1-scaled-md.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" loading="lazy" height="1440" width="2560" alt=""></a><p></p><p>It was always sort of planned that at some point, our model trains would move elsewhere.
