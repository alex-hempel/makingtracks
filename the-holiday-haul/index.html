Be it new rolling stock, technical equipment or other useful things - something always gets added. This year's haul was unexpectedly big, due to some opportunity purchases that I normally wouldn't have made, but couldn't pass up. So here's the rundown of the new additions to the fleet.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The first addition was a set of VAK coal hoppers. These models, made by Australian manufacturer Southern Rail, have been virtually sold out for some time. I previously acquired a set of four VGK hoppers to serve as coal cars with my <a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/2018/12/18/unboxing-the-southern-rail-models-qr-2300-class/">QR 2300 class</a>, whose real-life purpose is almost exclusively coal traffic. The VGKs could class as cheating, since they are upgraded VAKs specifically for grain transport, but since they were the only ones I could get my hands on at the time, they'll do. Four cars in a train looks puny even on a small layout, so I was very happy to find another set of actual VAKS for a damn good price. Second hand, yes, but barely used.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Fun fact: a real-life coal train in South East Queensland consists of two locos and 40 cars.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/img_1984.jpg" data-size="3024x4032" data-gall="galleryGroup-1" data-title="Southern Rail VAK coal hoppers in Aurizon livery"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/img_1984-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="960"></a><figcaption>Southern Rail VAK coal hoppers in Aurizon livery</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5117.jpg" data-size="4246x1425" data-gall="galleryGroup-1" data-title="The new VAKs lined up in formation with my VGKs (right)"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5117-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="241"></a><figcaption>The new VAKs lined up in formation with my VGKs (right)</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5119.jpg" data-size="3849x1707" data-gall="galleryGroup-1" data-title="The difference between the VAK and VGK is that the VAK only has braking gear on one end – hence the ‘Direction of travel’ arrow."><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5119-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="319"></a><figcaption>The difference between the VAK and VGK is that the VAK only has braking gear on one end – hence the ‘Direction of travel’ arrow.</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5118.jpg" data-size="3486x1765" data-gall="galleryGroup-1" data-title="The VGKs, which derived from the VAKs, have brake gear on both ends, and normally sport a fibreglass cover."><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5118-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="364"></a><figcaption>The VGKs, which derived from the VAKs, have brake gear on both ends, and normally sport a fibreglass cover.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>From the same seller I acquired a set of three KOJX cattle wagons as used in Queensland. I already had a set of them, but never did much with them because I didn't have a matching loco - the 2300 could have done in a pinch, but it didn't feel quite right, since, as mentioned above, it is a dedicated coal loco. Still, these were practically free, so why not?</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/img_1985.jpg" data-size="3024x4029" data-gall="galleryGroup-2" data-title="KOJX cattle wagons as used in Queensland in the 80s and 90s"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/img_1985-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="959"></a><figcaption>KOJX cattle wagons as used in Queensland in the 80s and 90s</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5133.jpg" data-size="4247x2115" data-gall="galleryGroup-2" data-title="Here, have a close-up"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5133-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="358"></a><figcaption>Here, have a close-up</figcaption></figure></div></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>And the cattle cars would not remain drive-less for long. Because we decided to finish what we started, and acquire the matching loco, a Queensland Rail 2170 class Diesel. The 2170 class is related to the 2300 class, both have a similar foundation, their key difference being the engines.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The 2170 started its life dedicated to coal freight, but was later assimilated into general freight service. This model comes from Southern Rail, same as the 2300, and carries early QR National livery. I have seen these in front of cattle trains, usually paired with a 2400 class, so it's at least plausible to have this one pull the KOJX cars. I see real life cattle trains consisting of 39 cars being hauled by two locos.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5129.jpg" data-size="4247x2105" data-gall="galleryGroup-3"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5129-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="357"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5130.jpg" data-size="3797x1952" data-gall="galleryGroup-3"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5130-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="370"></a></figure></div></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>And since it was so much fun, here's a short clip of both locos with their dedicated payload.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="700" height="394" style="width: 700px; height: 394px;" title="QR Freight Double Feature" src="https://makertube.net/videos/embed/a31fd0f4-f292-40dd-962c-9d7afc66ec4a" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms"></iframe></div></div></figure><p></p><p></p><p>So that's two freight trains sorted. But we didn't stop there. Ever since I acquired my Ludmilla, I wanted to give it something more to do than cleaning tracks. Matching rolling stock of Deutsche Reichsbahn Epoch IV does exist, but is either very expensive, or old and hard to come by down under. When I came across a collection of old Lima DB passenger cars, I decided to create an approximation of an Interzone train, or transit train, as they traveled between East and West Germany. These trains could consist of both DR and DB rolling stock, and would be operated by East German locomotives such as the Ludmilla, at least in East German territory.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="2"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5110.jpg" data-size="4234x2126" data-gall="galleryGroup-4" data-title="This Lima 1st Class express train car is a bit wobbly on its bogies, but that can be fixed."><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5110-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="362"></a><figcaption>This Lima 1st Class express train car is a bit wobbly on its bogies, but that can be fixed.</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5114.jpg" data-size="4246x1691" data-gall="galleryGroup-4" data-title="Then there are two 2nd Class cars, all with interior decoration."><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5114-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="287"></a><figcaption>Then there are two 2nd Class cars, all with interior decoration.</figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5115.jpg" data-size="3792x1572" data-gall="galleryGroup-4" data-title="Last not least, an express baggage car to round off the train"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5115-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="298"></a><figcaption>Last not least, an express baggage car to round off the train</figcaption></figure></div></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Now, such a train would have traveled long distances, and therefore would have had a restaurant car more often than not. With a modicum of research I worked out that both the East German Mitropa, and the West German DSG, may have operated restaurant cars in the kind of train I was trying to build. I became fond of the idea of adding a Mitropa car to the largely West German formation, which may not have been 100% typical. But as I read on a forum recently, there wasn't much that didn't happen in that era when it came to rolling stock combinations - and 'when in doubt, declare it a museum train'. Good enough.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I managed to get this car for a very decent price on Ebay. This is a model manufactured by East German manufacturer Schicht, which was a precursor to PIKO, and it would have been made anywhere between the late 60s and early 80s. For its age, it is in very good condition, even the interior lighting works.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5112.jpg" data-size="4246x2003" data-gall="galleryGroup-5" data-title="There is a good chance that this model is older than me"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5112-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="339"></a><figcaption>There is a good chance that this model is older than me</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>With the Lima cars, I also received a batch of Roco DB passenger cars of the same era. I didn't have a use for them, but they seller threw them in anyway. They are suitable to build an Epoch IV DB express train - known as D-Zug - but I need a matching loco for it.

For purposes of shuttling passengers between the upper village and the lake, we wanted a railcar which could change directions without it being too noticeable. It had to be reasonably short, and a diesel, which really limited the options. The original idea was for an older style rail bus of the Epoch III, but we decided we wanted something more modern. Most diesel railcars however come in multiple units of three to five cars, which really is too long for our setup. We ended up deciding on a model of the LINT 27, a one-piece railcar which was just the right size. Looks were secondary in this case, so the fact that this model carries the livery of defunct private operator Vectus has absolutely no meaning at all - it was available.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5134.jpg" data-size="4245x1205" data-gall="galleryGroup-7"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5134-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="204"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5138.jpg" data-size="4253x2636" data-gall="galleryGroup-7"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/gallery/IMG_5138-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="446"></a></figure></div></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>And that's the holiday haul for this season. We are getting to the point where each loco has a dedicated train and a purpose. Unfortunately, money is always a bit tight after the holidays, so further progress will take some time.</p><p></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__tag"><h3>Tagged in:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/tags/rolling-stock/">Rolling Stock</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee5c2941d2997b864e9173c270513a0c?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" height="240" width="240" alt="Alex"><div><h3><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/authors/alex/" class="invert" rel="author">Alex</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>© Alex Hempel 2018-2025.
