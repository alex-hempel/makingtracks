Be it new rolling stock, technical equipment or other useful things - something always gets added. This year's haul was unexpectedly big, due to some opportunity purchases that I normally wouldn't have made, but couldn't pass up. So here's the rundown of the new additions to the fleet.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The first addition was a set of VAK coal hoppers. These models, made by Australian manufacturer Southern Rail, have been virtually sold out for some time. I previously acquired a set of four VGK hoppers to serve as coal cars with my <a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/2018/12/18/unboxing-the-southern-rail-models-qr-2300-class/">QR 2300 class</a>, whose real-life purpose is almost exclusively coal traffic. The VGKs could class as cheating, since they are upgraded VAKs specifically for grain transport, but since they were the only ones I could get my hands on at the time, they'll do. Four cars in a train looks puny even on a small layout, so I was very happy to find another set of actual VAKS for a damn good price. Second hand, yes, but barely used.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Fun fact: a real-life coal train in South East Queensland consists of two locos and 40 cars.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/img_1984-scaled.jpg"><figure class="wp-image-472"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/img_1984-768x1024.jpg" alt="" data-id="472" data-full-url="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/img_1984-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/img_1984/" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/img_1984-768x1024-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/img_1984-768x1024-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/img_1984-768x1024-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/img_1984-768x1024-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/img_1984-768x1024-xl.jpg 1360w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/img_1984-768x1024-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption">Southern Rail VAK coal hoppers in Aurizon livery</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5117-scaled.jpg"><figure class="wp-image-466"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/IMG_5117-1024x344.jpg" alt="" data-id="466" data-full-url="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5117-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/img_5117/" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5117-1024x344-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5117-1024x344-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5117-1024x344-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5117-1024x344-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5117-1024x344-xl.jpg 1360w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5117-1024x344-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption">The new VAKs lined up in formation with my VGKs (right)</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5119-scaled.jpg"><figure class="wp-image-468"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/IMG_5119-1024x454.jpg" alt="" data-id="468" data-full-url="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5119-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/img_5119/" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5119-1024x454-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5119-1024x454-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5119-1024x454-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5119-1024x454-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5119-1024x454-xl.jpg 1360w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5119-1024x454-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption">The difference between the VAK and VGK is that the VAK only has braking gear on one end -

Because we decided to finish what we started, and acquire the matching loco, a Queensland Rail 2170 class Diesel. The 2170 class is related to the 2300 class, both have a similar foundation, their key difference being the engines.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The 2170 started its life dedicated to coal freight, but was later assimilated into general freight service. This model comes from Southern Rail, same as the 2300, and carries early QR National livery. I have seen these in front of cattle trains, usually paired with a 2400 class, so it's at least plausible to have this one pull the KOJX cars. I see real life cattle trains consisting of 39 cars being hauled by two locos.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5129-scaled.jpg"><figure class="wp-image-476"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/IMG_5129-1024x508.jpg" alt="" data-id="476" data-full-url="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5129-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/img_5129/" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5129-1024x508-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5129-1024x508-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5129-1024x508-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5129-1024x508-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5129-1024x508-xl.jpg 1360w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5129-1024x508-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5130-scaled.jpg"><figure class="wp-image-477"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/IMG_5130-1024x526.jpg" alt="" data-id="477" data-full-url="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5130-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/img_5130/" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5130-1024x526-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5130-1024x526-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5130-1024x526-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5130-1024x526-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5130-1024x526-xl.jpg 1360w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5130-1024x526-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a></figure></li></ul></figure><p></p><p></p><p>And since it was so much fun, here's a short clip of both locos with their dedicated payload.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">https://youtu.be/TPV_0TXx6L4</div></figure><p></p><p></p><p>So that's two freight trains sorted. But we didn't stop there. Ever since I acquired my Ludmilla, I wanted to give it something more to do than cleaning tracks. Matching rolling stock of Deutsche Reichsbahn Epoch IV does exist, but is either very expensive, or old and hard to come by down under. When I came across a collection of old Lima DB passenger cars, I decided to create an approximation of an Interzone train, or transit train, as they traveled between East and West Germany. These trains could consist of both DR and DB rolling stock, and would be operated by East German locomotives such as the Ludmilla, at least in East German territory.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5110-scaled.jpg"><figure class="wp-image-462"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/IMG_5110-1024x514.jpg" alt="" data-id="462" data-full-url="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5110-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/img_5110/" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5110-1024x514-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5110-1024x514-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5110-1024x514-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5110-1024x514-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5110-1024x514-xl.jpg 1360w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5110-1024x514-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption">This Lima 1st Class express train car is a bit wobbly on its bogies, but that can be fixed.</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5114-scaled.jpg"><figure class="wp-image-464"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/IMG_5114-1024x408.jpg" alt="" data-id="464" data-full-url="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5114-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/img_5114/" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5114-1024x408-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5114-1024x408-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5114-1024x408-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5114-1024x408-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5114-1024x408-xl.jpg 1360w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5114-1024x408-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption">Then there are two 2nd Class cars, all with interior decoration.</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5115-scaled.jpg"><figure class="wp-image-465"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/IMG_5115-1024x425.jpg" alt="" data-id="465" data-full-url="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5115-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/img_5115/" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5115-1024x425-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5115-1024x425-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5115-1024x425-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5115-1024x425-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5115-1024x425-xl.jpg 1360w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5115-1024x425-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-item__caption">Last not least, an express baggage car to round off the train</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Now, such a train would have traveled long distances, and therefore would have had a restaurant car more often than not. With a modicum of research I worked out that both the East German Mitropa, and the West German DSG, may have operated restaurant cars in the kind of train I was trying to build. I became fond of the idea of adding a Mitropa car to the largely West German formation, which may not have been 100% typical. But as I read on a forum recently, there wasn't much that didn't happen in that era when it came to rolling stock combinations - and 'when in doubt, declare it a museum train'. Good enough.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I managed to get this car for a very decent price on Ebay. This is a model manufactured by East German manufacturer Schicht, which was a precursor to PIKO, and it would have been made anywhere between the late 60s and early 80s. For its age, it is in very good condition, even the interior lighting works.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5112-scaled.jpg"><figure class="wp-image-463"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/IMG_5112-1024x483.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5112-1024x483-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5112-1024x483-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5112-1024x483-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5112-1024x483-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5112-1024x483-xl.jpg 1360w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5112-1024x483-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a><figcaption>There is a good chance that this model is older than me</figcaption></figure><p></p><p></p><p>With the Lima cars, I also received a batch of Roco DB passenger cars of the same era.

For purposes of shuttling passengers between the upper village and the lake, we wanted a railcar which could change directions without it being too noticeable. It had to be reasonably short, and a diesel, which really limited the options. The original idea was for an older style rail bus of the Epoch III, but we decided we wanted something more modern. Most diesel railcars however come in multiple units of three to five cars, which really is too long for our setup. We ended up deciding on a model of the LINT 27, a one-piece railcar which was just the right size. Looks were secondary in this case, so the fact that this model carries the livery of defunct private operator Vectus has absolutely no meaning at all - it was available.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5134-scaled.jpg"><figure class="wp-image-479"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/IMG_5134-1024x291.jpg" alt="" data-id="479" data-full-url="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5134-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/img_5134/" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5134-1024x291-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5134-1024x291-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5134-1024x291-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5134-1024x291-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5134-1024x291-xl.jpg 1360w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5134-1024x291-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5138-scaled.jpg"><figure class="wp-image-480"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/IMG_5138-1024x635.jpg" alt="" data-id="480" data-full-url="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_5138-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/img_5138/" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5138-1024x635-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5138-1024x635-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5138-1024x635-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5138-1024x635-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5138-1024x635-xl.jpg 1360w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/26/responsive/IMG_5138-1024x635-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a></figure></li></ul></figure><p></p><p></p><p>And that's the holiday haul for this season.
