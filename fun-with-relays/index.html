Currently I have two buildings with functions that I want to turn off and on at will: a lighthouse, and a windmill.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The windmill came with a motor specifically operating on 16V AC. In anticipation of this, I built a 16V AC wire bus under my layout quite some time ago. That came in handy when the lighthouse was built, since it is capable of operating on that same voltage.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To control any accessories I intended to use the same <a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/point-motor-shoot-out-servo-and-volley/">MarDec devices</a> which I am using to control servos: Arduino-based accessory decoders with high flexibility. Out of the box MarDec supports servo control as well as a number of ways to control other accessories, including steady power, flashing lights and similar. However, using the output of these devices to power accessories directly is only suitable for things that work with 5V and draw low amperage. For anything else, additional work is required. When you do a bit of research, you'll hear talk about Mosfet switches, transistors or relays. What you end up using is - largely - up to your confidence with electronics and appetite for complexity.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I quickly decided to go with relays. The other options don't readily offer themselves for use with AC, as far as I was able to determine with my limited electronics knowledge. Relays are quite simple to wire in, all they need is a power source and a signal, and then they pass through whatever is connected to the right contacts (within their specs, of course). How that's done with the windmill is shown in the below graphic.</p><p></p><p></p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/7/gallery/relay_accessories.png" data-size="1070x828" data-gall="galleryGroup-1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/7/gallery/relay_accessories-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="720" height="557"></a></figure></div></div><p></p><p></p><p>The 16V AC are connected to the common and the Normally Open (NO) connector. A proper DC power supply is connected to DC+ and DC- connectors - in my case that's 5V, but these relays are available for different operating voltages. Lastly, one of the Mardec ports is connected to the IN connector, and the port is configured to provide a single steady signal when activated, which happens through a DCC accessory address. On activation, the relay is triggered and the 16V AC flows through to the motor in the windmill - or any other accessory wired this way.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What I learned about relays has also come in helpful for another small project I'm working on. But that will be subject of a separate post. In the meantime, I'll just show off the two buildings that I can now control with relays. Stay tuned.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-video"><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; border-style: none;" border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 49.9288%;"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="348" height="196" style="width: 348px; height: 196px;" title="Windmill" src="https://makertube.net/videos/embed/56822c6d-7001-4a11-9c18-e5f86fa7bdff" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms"></iframe></div></td><td style="width: 49.9288%;"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="348" height="196" style="width: 348px; height: 196px;" title="Lighthouse" src="https://makertube.net/videos/embed/ca1349c0-3108-4ff8-ba4b-368bfa4c4ef4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms"></iframe></div></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__tag"><h3>Tagged in:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/tags/accessories/">Accessories</a></li><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/tags/arduino/">Arduino</a></li><li><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/tags/dcc/">DCC</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee5c2941d2997b864e9173c270513a0c?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" height="240" width="240" alt="Alex"><div><h3><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/authors/alex/" class="invert" rel="author">Alex</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><div><strong>You should also read:</strong></div><div class="posts"><article><header><time datetime="2025-01-06T10:03" class="date">6 January 2025</time><h2><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/fun-with-signals/">Fun with Signals</a></h2></header><a href="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/fun-with-signals/" class="image fit"><img src="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/48/img_7530-scaled.jpg" srcset="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/48/responsive/img_7530-scaled-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/48/responsive/img_7530-scaled-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/48/responsive/img_7530-scaled-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/48/responsive/img_7530-scaled-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/media/posts/48/responsive/img_7530-scaled-xl.jpg 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="1441" width="2560" alt=""></a><p></p><p></p><p>Some time ago I took delivery of my first batch of signals. These are generic 3-light signals made in China. They aren't particularly prototypical - the aspects resemble a type of signal used here in Queensland, as well as some European signals.
