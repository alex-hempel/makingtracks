Opinions are split as to whether it's any good at all. In forum discussions I have read, some people defend sound in models as an addition to the perceived realism of their setups. On the other side of the table, there are those who prefer not to run with sound because it never really sounds like the real thing anyway. Then the next question often argued is how detailed and close to the original the sound has to be - or not.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It is hard to replicate the real life sound a 120 ton locomotive makes passing by into a 20cm long and 600g heavy scale model. It's not just the engine or the noise the rolling stock makes, it's the vibrations of the ground, reverbs and echoes based on the environment. Sounds for non-steam model trains are often recorded inside the engine room, but a loco does sound differently on the outside. Speakers used inside the locos contribute a lot to how good a model loco can sound - but there is limited space inside those things, and fitting larger speakers to provide a more optimal experience is not everyone's cup of tea, especially when it means needing to cut out parts of the chassis.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Another factor is the effort and level of detail that has been put into creating and tuning the sounds for any given model. As I learned with my latest acquisition, a sound-equipped model of the iconic Russian-built BR 132, also known as 'Ludmilla'.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It's a loco whose looks I am reasonably familiar with, having travelled on a number of trains pulled by one of them. Over 800 of the overall class were built for use in heavy freight and cross-border passenger services in East Germany. Many of them are still in service today, for DB Cargo and a number of private rail companies across Europe.</p><p></p><p></p><p>My Ludmilla is a model of <a href="http://br232.com/index.php?nav=1407384&amp;lang=1&amp;id=33592&amp;action=portrait">132 097-7</a> made by Roco, the original having been built in 1974 and operated until 2008. While the original loco was re-numbered and re-painted a few times in its life, this model bears the original DR livery from the 1980s. Its main purpose on my layout is to run the cleaning train, which I will talk about in more detail another time. It's a perfect model for this task: heavy, robust and with a lot of pulling power, while able to navigate tighter curves which not all big model locos can do. Here are a few shots of it.</p><p></p><p></p><ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/img_1451-1024x768.jpg"><figure class="wp-image-438"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/img_1451-1024x768.jpg" alt="" data-id="438" data-link="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/img_1451/" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1451-1024x768-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1451-1024x768-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1451-1024x768-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1451-1024x768-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1451-1024x768-xl.jpg 1360w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1451-1024x768-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a><figcaption>Ten minutes after unpacking, still without any detail parts</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/img_1514-1024x768.jpg"><figure class="wp-image-437"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/img_1514-1024x768.jpg" alt="" data-id="437" data-link="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/img_1514/" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1514-1024x768-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1514-1024x768-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1514-1024x768-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1514-1024x768-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1514-1024x768-xl.jpg 1360w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1514-1024x768-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a><figcaption>Ludmilla on cleaning duty</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/img_1624-1024x768.jpg"><figure class="wp-image-436"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/img_1624-1024x768.jpg" alt="" data-id="436" data-link="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/img_1624/" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1624-1024x768-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1624-1024x768-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1624-1024x768-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1624-1024x768-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1624-1024x768-xl.jpg 1360w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1624-1024x768-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a><figcaption>Passing by</figcaption></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><a href="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/img_1642-1024x768.jpg"><figure class="wp-image-435"><img loading="lazy" src="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/img_1642-1024x768.jpg" alt="" data-id="435" data-link="https://makingtracks.ah-web.org/img_1642/" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1642-1024x768-xs.jpg 300w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1642-1024x768-sm.jpg 480w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1642-1024x768-md.jpg 768w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1642-1024x768-lg.jpg 1024w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1642-1024x768-xl.jpg 1360w, https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/media/posts/25/responsive/img_1642-1024x768-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></a><figcaption>Parked at the Diesel fuelling facility in the yard</figcaption></figure></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>This model by Roco is equipped with a Zimo sound decoder, and a pretty good one at that. The loco runs very smoothly at any given speed. Initially I was happy with the sound, too, but later I learned that the stock sound project installed in this loco did not do justice to both the prototype and the capabilities of the decoder. Here's what it sounded like ex factory.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drSnvQICrBQ</div></figure><p></p><p></p><p>I heard samples of more authoritative sound projects and quickly got to the point where I wanted a 'better' sound on my model. The beauty about European sound decoders is that both firmware and sound projects can generally be updated by the user. However, in most cases that requires not only specialised software, but also a specific piece of equipment. In Zimo's case, that equipment is either their DCC command central MX10 (the black Roco Z21 can also be used for newer decoder types), or a special programming device called MXULFA. Either of these would have set me back way more money than I was willing and able to spend on this endeavour.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So I reached out for help in my surrounding areas, and found a fellow modeller who not only called an MXULFA their own, but was more than willing to help me get the new sound loaded on this model. It was a 140km drive each way, but here abouts that qualifies as 'surrounding areas'.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It was absolutely worth it. I loaded the BR 132 sound project by <a href="https://www.henning-modellbahn.de/">Matthias Henning</a>, which is, according to discussions in various forums, one of the best sound projects available for this model. It features a more authentic rendition of the characteristic startup sequence of the Kolomna engine, as well as driving sounds that appear more realistic. The below video shows the full spin-up and spin-down sequence of this sound project, as well as some driving sounds.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5-ab8h-5Kw</div></figure><p></p><p></p><p>Sound in model trains can be a gimmick, or it can add to the immersion of the hobby. A number of factors play into whether it's one or the other. The sound change on this model made a big difference to me, and while it could probably also benefit from a slightly bigger speaker, I am very happy I got this loco and had it updated.</p><p></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__tag"><h3>Tagged in:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/tags/ludmilla/">Ludmilla</a></li><li><a href="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/tags/musings/">Musings</a></li><li><a href="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/tags/sound/">Sound</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee5c2941d2997b864e9173c270513a0c?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" height="240" width="240" alt="Alex"><div><h3><a href="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/authors/alex/" class="invert" rel="author">Alex</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>© Alex Hempel 2025</li><li>Design: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HTML5 UP</a></li><li>Powered by Publii</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://makingtrackstest.ah-web.org/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
